                <p class="lead">In a striking address to hundreds of university students gathered at the Vatican, Pope Leo XIV delivered his most forceful warning yet about the dangers of algorithmic control over human lives.</p>
                
                <p>"Don't let the algorithm write your story!" the pontiff declared. "Be the authors: Use technology wisely, but don't let technology use you."</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>The Context</h2>
                <p>Speaking at the Paul VI Audience Hall as part of the Jubilee of the World of Education, Pope Leo XIV—a former mathematics teacher—addressed the generation growing up entirely within the digital ecosystem.</p>
                
                <p>The Chicago-born pontiff warned that many young people experience a sense of emptiness or inner restlessness, pointing to episodes of distress, violence, bullying, and isolation as symptoms of "a void created by a society that has forgotten how to form the spiritual dimension of the human person."</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Three Key Challenges</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Cultivate Your Interior Life</h3>
                <p>"Having a great deal of knowledge is not enough if we do not know who we are or what the meaning of life is," Pope Leo told students. He urged them to rediscover the inner dimension of life, warning that "without silence, without listening, without prayer, even the light of the stars goes out."</p>

                <h3>2. Don't Let Technology Control You</h3>
                <p>The pope acknowledged the enormous opportunities of digital education but cautioned against letting the digital world become "a cage where you lock yourselves in" or "an addiction or an escape."</p>

                <h3>3. Be Peacemakers</h3>
                <p>Leo called for "an education for peace that is disarmed and disarming," one that creates equality and growth for all, recognizing the equal dignity of every young person.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                <p>Pope Leo XIV's statement represents the Catholic Church's most direct challenge to the algorithmic society. Unlike previous papal statements that focused on AI development or policy, this address targets individual agency—the daily choices young people make about screen time, social media consumption, and digital dependency.</p>
                
                <p>The timing is significant. As AI systems become more sophisticated at predicting and influencing human behavior, the question of personal autonomy becomes increasingly urgent.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>The Broader Vision</h2>
                <p>This address continues Pope Leo XIV's consistent theme since his election: that artificial intelligence represents a challenge to human dignity comparable to the First Industrial Revolution.</p>
                
                <p>By choosing the name Leo XIV in honor of Pope Leo XIII—whose encyclical *Rerum Novarum* defended workers' rights during industrialization—the current pontiff has signaled his intent to offer the Church's wisdom on technology, labor, and human dignity.</p>

                <h2>Practical Implications</h2>
                <p>What does it mean to "not let the algorithm write your story"? Pope Leo offers concrete guidance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Practice silence and reflection</strong> — Create space for your interior life away from digital stimulation</li>
                    <li><strong>Question algorithmic recommendations</strong> — Don't passively accept what AI suggests you watch, read, or buy</li>
                    <li><strong>Build genuine relationships</strong> — Prioritize face-to-face connection over digital interaction</li>
                    <li><strong>Develop moral discernment</strong> — Cultivate the ability to judge right from wrong independently</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Response</h2>
                <p>The address was met with enthusiastic applause from the students. The pope's approachable style—joking about math exams and speaking off-script—resonated with the young audience.</p>
                
                <p>On social media, the hashtag #DontLetTheAlgorithm trended briefly, with young Catholics sharing their own struggles with digital dependency.</p>
